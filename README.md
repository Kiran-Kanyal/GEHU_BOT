# University Admission Chatbot

A simple chatbot built in Python that answers university admission-related queries. The chatbot uses predefined intent data stored in a `intents.json` file to understand and respond to common questions about the admission process, eligibility criteria, courses, deadlines, and more.

## Features

- Responds to user queries related to university admission.
- Uses a `intents.json` file to store user intents and responses.
- Built with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
- Easy to extend with additional intents or other features.
  
## Technologies Used

- Python
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) with libraries like `NLTK`
- JSON for storing intents
- `scikit-learn` for machine learning
  
## Prerequisites

Before running the chatbot, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `nltk` (Natural Language Toolkit)
- `scikit-learn` (if using machine learning for intent classification)
- `json` (standard Python library for working with JSON data)
  
To install the required libraries, use the following command:

```bash
pip install nltk scikit-learn
